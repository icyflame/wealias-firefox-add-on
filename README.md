# WeAlias - Clone

> Clone of [WeAlias Firefox Extension][1] by [Filbio][2]

This is an exact clone of Filbio's original except for the keyword inside the
manifest. Filbio's original extension uses the letter `a` as the keyword,
whereas this add-on uses the letter `j`

All credit for this extension goes to Filbio!
